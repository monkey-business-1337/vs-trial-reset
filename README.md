Reset trial on Visual Studio Community Edition

Idea - https://stackoverflow.com/a/51570570

Note that latest versions of VS checks trial period length and fires alarm if it longer than month (maybe + several days, idunno). So you can't set expiration date more than (current date + 31 days).

You need VS 2017 to build it. Also you need to start compiled binary as admin.

Tested on VS 2017 15.8.x, 2019 16.3.x.
